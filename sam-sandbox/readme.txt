As of 3/3/2016, this directory contains my SVM that uses the 1024 features Frank derived, along with some supporting scripts. The main script is yelp_svm.py, which trains and evaluates the model.

Note that because I was having trouble with pickle files and different python versions, I converted features.pickle to 3 .npy files, which are needed by yelp_svm.py:
  https://s3.amazonaws.com/srs-yelp-kaggle/data/train-business_ids.npy
  https://s3.amazonaws.com/srs-yelp-kaggle/data/train-photo_ids.npy
  https://s3.amazonaws.com/srs-yelp-kaggle/data/train-features.npy

(This was done using convert.py.)

Also, the EMD matrix generated by build_emd_matrix.py, wrapped by EMDMatrix.py, and needed by yelp_svm.py if using the method 'svm-emd', is also in 3 files:
  https://s3.amazonaws.com/srs-yelp-kaggle/data/emd-train-colids.npy
  https://s3.amazonaws.com/srs-yelp-kaggle/data/emd-train-rowids.npy
  https://s3.amazonaws.com/srs-yelp-kaggle/data/emd-train-data.npy
